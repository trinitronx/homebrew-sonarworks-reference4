Install Sonarworks Reference 4 via Homebrew

This recipe is designed to install the latest Sonarworks Reference 4 via the MacOS installer.  Note that Homebrew project will reject Casks or Formulae that have volatile download links (see [homebrew-cask#57634](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/57634)).  Currently this Cask does not appear to suffer from that issue, so it may be a good candidate for future incorporation into homebrew/homebrew-cask.  For now, I will try to maintain this here in incubation phase because it is useful to me and might be for others. :smile:

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) and [`homebrew-cask`](http://caskroom.io/) if you haven't yet.

Then, run the following in your command-line:

    brew tap trinitronx/homebrew-sonarworks-reference4

## Usage

**Note**: For info run:

    brew info --cask sonarworks-reference4

Once the tap is installed, you can install `sonarworks-reference4`!

    brew install --cask sonarworks-reference4

To uninstall run:

    brew uninstall --cask sonarworks-reference4

## Development

If you wish to contribute to this Cask, there is a helper `Makefile` with some useful targets.

To checkout this repo and install in development mode:

    git clone https://github.com/trinitronx/homebrew-sonarworks-reference4.git
    cd homebrew-sonarworks-reference4
    make install

This will install a symbolic link to this git repo under: `$(brew --repo)/Library/Taps/trinitronx/homebrew-sonarworks-reference4`

Then, you may edit and test the Homebrew Cask recipe from the cloned git repo file location.

## Testing

    make test
